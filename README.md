 Data augmentation
Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data.
This repo demonstrates how to use data augmentation on images using TensorFlow's Keras API

It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a model
